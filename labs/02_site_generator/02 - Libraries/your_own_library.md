# Develop the Micro Library Further

In the course you have started out creating your own library that serves as an abstraction to create elements without typing too much.

Customize it, change the way an element can be created or create more specific functions to do different tasks.

You should have one project which is the demo project that is shown in the course, and another that you put your own spin on. Use your customized version of the library to work on your own project.

Change the function names, and the arguments you pass to it. Change the way you interact with it. Split up the functionality, have various creator functions. It's all up to you, go wild!

Inlcude the current version of your JS library as a file in this folder.
