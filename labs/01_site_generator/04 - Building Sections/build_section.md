1. In your personal parallel project, put a spin on the function. Write it in a different way.

One possible approach is to split up the arguments, so that you don't pass in a `section` object, but instead you pass in the text and the source image as individual values, not packaged up in an object as it is done in the module project.

Experiment! There is no single right way. Every approach has trade offs.

2. Write down two advantages and disadvantages of the approach taken in the demo project, and do the same for your own project.

3. Make sure you have all the sections built out in your own project and that you have put your own spin on things.
