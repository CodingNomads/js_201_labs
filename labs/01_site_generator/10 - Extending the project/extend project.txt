Make your own recipe that uses some more elements and then implement them.

Maybe another type of section. Or a different way of building sections.

If you come from the Python or Java course, you could build a way to convert a subset of Markdown into the recipe, which could then be served by a server and translated by your front end. It would be a website making machine!
