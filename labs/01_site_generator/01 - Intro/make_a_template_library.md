# Make Some Templates

Being able to quickly spin up a new sample project or sandbox environment is an essential skill for any developer.

1. If you haven't already got a GitHub repository for your snippets or templates, make one now.
2. Create a template HTML file that has a few elements, a button, and some script tags. Something that you can quickly copy and experiment with.
3. Create a template HTML, CSS and JS file, all linked up, again so you can copy the containing folder and have something to experiment and test with.
4. Create a copy of each of these templates and call them "Scratch", which can serve as a scratch pad for you to test out quick transient snippets that you will delete later.
5. Go to codesandbox.io and to codepen.io, create an account and explore the offerings there. These are also great for testing, but there are limitations that you may run into because they are not local projects.
