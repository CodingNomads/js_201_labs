# Get Wireframing

In front end development there is always overwhelming choice. It makes for a much more focused workflow if you get into the habit of sketching and wireframing your projects before diving in.

1. Do you have a drawing program that you like? If not, try <https://app.diagrams.net/> and make a test drawing and save it.
2. With this, make a rough wireframe for a website of your choice and save it as a PNG file.
3. Display the PNG files in the sandbox.
