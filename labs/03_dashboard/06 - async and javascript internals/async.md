# Practicing and Understanding Async

Make sure you have done the labs on Promises before starting these labs.

1. Taking the random number generator that returns a promise, use this in an asynchronous function to get 5 numbers and log their sum to the console.

    ```js
    // Copy your answer here
    ```

2. In a new local sandbox project, write an async function that will fetch data from an API of your choice and log the result to the console.

    ```js
    // Copy your answer here
    ```

3. Write an async function that will take a random number from the generator you have, and make it so that the function has a 50/50 chance to call one API or another and log their results.

    ```js
    // Copy your answer here
    ```

4. Write an async function that returns when a button is pressed. Use this function in another function that will act as a counter, logging incrementing numbers every time the button is pressed.

    ```js
    // Copy your answer here
    ```

5. Write an async function that returns a random number. Then use this async function in a promise chain log three random numbers one after the other.

    ```js
    // Copy your answer here
    ```
