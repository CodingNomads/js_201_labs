# Practice Promises

1. Create a function that creates a random number and returns a promise that resolves to the random number.

    ```js
    // Write the function here
    
    
    
    ```

2. Use this function to get two random numbers and add them together. Log the result to the console.

    ```js
    // Write your answer here
    
    
    ```

3. Start a sandbox project locally, and make a request to an API using promises, log the output to the console.

    ```js
    // Copy your JavaScript here
    ```

4. In the same sandbox project, use `Promise.all()` to make two requests, and then log their results to the console.
