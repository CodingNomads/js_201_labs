Although the pizza example does not need any asynchronous processing, in this lab you'll be writing a version that uses async functions.

First, write a could of functions that return promises after a short delay, these should represent a pizza that is being baked, and a pizza that is being delivered.
That is, a function that returns a promise that resolves to either a baked pizza or a burnt pizza.
And a function that returns a promise that resolves to either a delivered pizza or a lost driver.
