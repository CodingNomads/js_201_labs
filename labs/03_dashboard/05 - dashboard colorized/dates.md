# Practicing Working with Dates

1. Write the code needed to add 10 seconds onto a newly initialized `Date` object.

    ```js
    const now = new Date()
    // write your answer here
    ```

2. With this date object, add 23 milliseconds to it.

3. Again, using the same date object, print out, on separate lines, the year, the month, the day, the hours, the minutes and the seconds.

4. Print out this date object as the number of milliseconds since 00:00 on the 1st of January 1970.

5. Print out this date object as the number of _seconds_ since 00:00 on the 1st of Janurary 1970.
