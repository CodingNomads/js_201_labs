# Practicing Working with Dates

1. Write the code needed to add 10 seconds onto a newly initialized `Date` object.

    ```js
    const now = new Date()
    // write your answer here
    ```

2. With this date object, add 23 milliseconds to it, and log the new Date

    ```js
    // Write the JavaScript needed to do that and your answer here
    ```

3. Again, using the same date object, print out, on separate lines, the year, the month, the day, the hours, the minutes and the seconds.

    ```js
    // Write the JavaScript needed to do that and your answer here
    ```

4. Log this date object as the number of _milliseconds_ since 00:00 on the 1st of January 1970.

    ```js
    // Write the JavaScript needed to do that and your answer here
    ```

5. Multiply the resultant integer by `1.2` and then convert it back into a date.

    ```js
    // Write the JavaScript needed to do that and your answer here
    ```

6. Use `Intl` to log your Date object in 3 different time zones.

    ```js
    // Write the JavaScript needed to do that and your answer here
    ```

7. Use `Intl` to log your Date object in 3 different formats.

    ```js
    // Write the JavaScript needed to do that and your answer here
    ```
